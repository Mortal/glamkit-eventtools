TODO

Occurrences know if they are the opening or closing occurrences for their event.

You can filter an Occurrence queryset to show only those occurrences that are opening or closing.

The custom admin occurrence view lists the occurrences of an event and all its children. Each occurrence shows which event it is linked to.

The custom admin view can be used to assign a different event to an occurrence. The drop-down list only shows the given event and its children.

    
Warning
The “delete selected objects” action uses QuerySet.delete() for efficiency reasons, which has an important caveat: your model’s delete() method will not be called.

If you wish to override this behavior, simply write a custom action which accomplishes deletion in your preferred manner – for example, by calling Model.delete() for each of the selected items.

For more background on bulk deletion, see the documentation on object deletion.
