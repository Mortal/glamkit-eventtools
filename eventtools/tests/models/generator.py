        Occurrences can be generated by a Generator. An event can have many Generators.
        A Generator has event, start datetime, end datetime, rule, repeat_until,
        and 'exceptions'.

        (`exceptions` is a JSONfield of start/end datetime pairs that the generator
        skips over if it was about to generate them).
        
        A generator generates occurrences by repeating start/end datetimes according
        to the rule, until repeat_until is about to be exceeded.

        If repeat_until is omitted (and rule is set) then repetitions are created upto
        a preset period into the future. The preset is in settings. The preset period
        is continually updated.
        
        Every time a generator is saved, it does its generating.
        Every time an event is saved, generators with a rule and no repeat_until do their generating.

        A generator will not save occurrences for an event that are the same as occurrences
        already in the database (even if they were created by another generator).
        However, occurrences that differ only in start time or end time ARE generated,

        Occurrences are saved to the database, and have an FK to the generator that
        did so. The FK can be set to None so that an occurrence can be detatched from a generator.
